Server Import Script Overview

The server script uses Firebase Admin SDK to upload the user and plant data from db.js to the Firebase Realtime Database.
It initializes Firebase using a service account JSON key and uses environment variables to access the database URL.
The script loops through each user and uploads them under the users/ reference, with the user ID as a key.
Once run, all users and their plant data become available in the Firebase console for use by the smart irrigation system app.
plantData: Imported plant data (assumed to be an array).
../styles/AddButton.css: CSS file for styling the button.
